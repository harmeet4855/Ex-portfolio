Work involved primarily quantitative research into the problems faced and the state of art, further data visualization was used for a clear visual representation of data collected from questionnaire responses and several conclusions were made based on these visualizations pointing to the need of a flexible date booking model. &nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>Airline companies have a very smart policy of dynamic Pricing where the ticket price varies on parameters which the company identifies and in such a manner that is most favourable to the company in terms of profit. As a result majority of the consumers which here implies commuters prefer booking the ticket well in advance which in turn leads to an uncertainty in many cases related to the exact travel date.&nbsp;The same ticket when rescheduled, in case travel plans need to be modified incur upon the consumers heavy charge in comparison to the original ticket price which was booked way too early owing to the very policies of dynamic pricing and skyrocketing flight process.There needs to be some flexibility in this regard which makes the decision making process easy for the consumers, which provides a shield to the commuters against this clever dynamic pricing which leaves them helpless and which is mutually rewarding for the commuters and the flight companies so that they can survive in the cut throat coompetition they engage in with their competitors.</p>
